# Upcoming - From Particles to Abstract Proof: Pure Maths' Role in the Quantum Rabi Model

**Seminar:** [Lancaster University Postgraduate Forum](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/)

**Location:** Lancaster University, United Kingdom

**Abstract:** The Quantum Rabi model provides a fundamental model for light-matter interaction. Developed for classical oscillating fields in 1938 by Rabi and the full quantum version in 1963 by Jaynes and Cummings, it is a vital model in physics with applications in areas such as quantum optics, quantum electrodynamics, and quantum computing.

Working with this model can be challenging. For example, a key interest is finding its eigenvalues, which physically represent energy levels. This was recently done by Braak in 2011, around 50 years after the quantum model was introduced.

Under certain conditions, in their 1963 paper Jaynes and Cummings argued that we can replace the Quantum Rabi model with the Jaynes-Cummings model through the rotating wave approximation. This was physically motivated and confirmed by experiments, and a rigorous justification was recently published in 2024 by Burgarth, Facchi, Hillier, and Ligabò by showing state-dependent convergence of the respective time evolutions.

In this talk, we explore the mathematical interest in the Quantum Rabi model. We start with a brief overview on the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics. We explain what it means to rigorously approximate the Quantum Rabi model by the Jaynes-Cummings model from a mathematical perspective, providing an overview on the approach by Burgarth, Facchi, Hillier, and Ligabò. Finally, we introduce an approach currently being developed by myself, Robin Hillier, and Daniel Elton to justify this approximation through the homogenization theory of differential equations.

No previous knowledge of operator theory, quantum mechanics, or homogenization theory will be assumed.

# An Invitation to Mathematical Quantum Physics

**Seminar:** [Lancaster University Postgraduate Forum](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/)

**Location:** Lancaster University, United Kingdom

**Date:** 27/11/2023

**Abstract:** In the early 20th century, experiments showed that quantum particles behave very differently compared to the non-quantum world that we are used to. Not only do quantum particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behaviour, but they also have a probabilistic nature to them. The demand on mathematicians was that we needed new theory suitable to tackle these phenomena.

 

In this talk, we place ourselves in the shoes of a mathematician at the time who wishes to rigorously develop this theory. We look at how quantum physics has a natural framework through unbounded operators on Hilbert spaces, and some key differences between unbounded operators and bounded operators. We then turn to applying this theory in a quantum physics context.

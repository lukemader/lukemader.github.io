# Upcoming - The Rotating Frame Approximation Through Time Homogenization Of The Schrödinger Equation

**Conference:** [Young Functional Analysts Workshop 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/yfaw2025/home)

**Abstract:** In quantum mechanics, physical models are often described by self-adjoint operators satisfying the Schrödinger equation, known as Hamiltonians. Quite often, these Hamiltonians can be difficult to handle. A fundamental example is the quantum Rabi model, which was developed by Jaynes and Cummings in their 1963 paper. Explicitly calculating its spectrum can be difficult, with analytical solutions being recently given by Braak in 2011.

The rotating wave approximation is often used to replace the quantum Rabi model with the Jaynes-Cumming model, which can be easier to use. Where physically motivated and experimentally justified, a rigorous justification for this was recently published in 2024 by Burgarth, Facchi, Hillier, and Ligabò by showing state-dependent convergence of the respective time evolutions.

In this talk, we provide an overview on a mathematical justification for the rotating wave approximation of the classical Rabi model and quantum Rabi model. We discuss two recent methods in the literature to justify the rotating wave approximation on these models, before introducing methods being developed by Elton, Hillier, and myself which frame this approximation as a homogenization problem.

# From Particles to Abstract Proof: Pure Maths' Role in the Quantum Rabi Model

**Seminar:** [Lancaster University Postgraduate Forum](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/)

**Location:** Lancaster University, United Kingdom

**Abstract:** The Quantum Rabi model provides a fundamental model for light-matter interaction. Developed for classical oscillating fields in 1938 by Rabi and the full quantum version in 1963 by Jaynes and Cummings, it is a vital model in physics with applications in areas such as quantum optics, quantum electrodynamics, and quantum computing.

Working with this model can be challenging. For example, a key interest is finding its eigenvalues, which physically represent energy levels. This was recently done by Braak in 2011, around 50 years after the quantum model was introduced.

Under certain conditions, in their 1963 paper Jaynes and Cummings argued that we can replace the Quantum Rabi model with the Jaynes-Cummings model through the rotating wave approximation. This was physically motivated and confirmed by experiments, and a rigorous justification was recently published in 2024 by Burgarth, Facchi, Hillier, and Ligabò by showing state-dependent convergence of the respective time evolutions.

In this talk, we explore the mathematical interest in the Quantum Rabi model. We start with a brief overview on the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics. We explain what it means to rigorously approximate the Quantum Rabi model by the Jaynes-Cummings model from a mathematical perspective, providing an overview on the approach by Burgarth, Facchi, Hillier, and Ligabò. Finally, we introduce an approach currently being developed by myself, Daniel Elton, and Robin Hillier to justify this approximation through the homogenization theory of differential equations.

No previous knowledge of operator theory, quantum mechanics, or homogenization theory will be assumed.

# An Invitation to Mathematical Quantum Physics

**Seminar:** [Lancaster University Postgraduate Forum](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/)

**Location:** Lancaster University, United Kingdom

**Date:** 27/11/2023

**Abstract:** In the early 20th century, experiments showed that quantum particles behave very differently compared to the non-quantum world that we are used to. Not only do quantum particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behaviour, but they also have a probabilistic nature to them. The demand on mathematicians was that we needed new theory suitable to tackle these phenomena.

 

In this talk, we place ourselves in the shoes of a mathematician at the time who wishes to rigorously develop this theory. We look at how quantum physics has a natural framework through unbounded operators on Hilbert spaces, and some key differences between unbounded operators and bounded operators. We then turn to applying this theory in a quantum physics context.

# An Invitation to Mathematical Quantum Physics

**Seminar:** [Lancaster University Postgraduate Forum](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/)

**Abstract:** In the early 20th century, experiments showed that quantum particles behave very differently compared to the non-quantum world that we are used to. Not only do quantum particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behaviour, but they also have a probabilistic nature to them. The demand on mathematicians was that we needed new theory suitable to tackle these phenomena.

 

In this talk, we place ourselves in the shoes of a mathematician at the time who wishes to rigorously develop this theory. We look at how quantum physics has a natural framework through unbounded operators on Hilbert spaces, and some key differences between unbounded operators and bounded operators. We then turn to applying this theory in a quantum physics context.
